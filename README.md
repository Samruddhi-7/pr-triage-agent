> Read code, not just diff. An autonomous PR review agent that fetches diffs, runs real linting/testing/SAST tools, reasons over results via Groq (Llama 3.3 70B), and produces structured reviews with risk ratings — all without a paid API.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](pr_triage_agent/assets/architecture.svg)

**How it works (3 phases):**

### Phase 1: Input
`PRFetcher.fetch_diff()` calls the GitHub REST API (`Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.diff`) to get the unified diff of a PR, then `parse_diff()` converts it into structured dataclasses — `DiffFile` → `Hunk` → `DiffLine` with tracking of old/new line numbers, file status (added/modified/deleted/renamed), and add/delete counts. Also supports local git mode (`git diff base...head`).

### Phase 2: Reasoning Loop
1. **Build Prompt** — The structured diff and list of changed files are embedded in a system prompt that instructs the LLM (Llama 3.3 70B via Groq) to act as a code reviewer.
2. **Tool-Augmented Generation** — The LLM can request tool calls: `run_linter` (ruff), `run_tests` (pytest), `run_static_analysis` (bandit), `read_file`, and `search_codebase`. Each result is appended to the conversation history.
3. **Iterative Reasoning** — Up to 6 rounds of tool calls. The LLM decides when it has enough evidence to produce the final review.
4. **Reflection** — If the LLM's self-reported confidence is below 0.6, a reflection prompt re-queries the model to reconsider its findings. Only one extra round.

### Phase 3: Output
The agent produces a structured JSON review: `{risk_rating, confidence, summary, per_file_comments[{file, line, comment, severity}]}`. Nothing is auto-merged or auto-approved — all output is human-gated.

## Evaluation Results

We curate a dataset of **16 real merged PRs** from 6 popular Python projects (cpython, flask, click, httpx, requests, poetry) and compare the agent's flagged issues against documented ground-truth issues from the PR descriptions and review comments.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Precision** | *(requires API key — run `python -m pr_triage_agent eval`)* |
| **Recall** | *(requires API key — run `python -m pr_triage_agent eval`)* |
| **F1 Score** | *(requires API key — run `python -m pr_triage_agent eval`)* |
| **Dataset Size** | 16 PRs |
| **Issue Types** | security, logic_bug, missing_error_handling, regression |

**Run it yourself:**
```bash
python -m pr_triage_agent eval --limit 5
```

Results are written to `pr_triage_agent/evaluation/results/` as per-PR JSON files and an aggregate `results_summary.md`.

## Key Engineering Decisions

### Why Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) + sleep-based rate limiting
The goal was a fully functional agent with **zero API cost**. Groq's free tier offers 1,000 requests/day (30 RPM) for `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` — dramatically higher than most other free-tier alternatives. Groq's LPU hardware also delivers faster inference (394 tokens/sec), and the OpenAI-compatible API means standard tools work without a vendor SDK. A simple `time.sleep(2.4)` rate limiter with exponential backoff on 429s keeps us compliant. Cost logging to SQLite tracks usage for when you eventually want to upgrade.

### Why hand-wrapped tools instead of LangChain / CrewAI
Heavy agent frameworks abstract away the function-calling loop and make debugging harder. By hand-wrapping 5 tools (`ToolSet` returning `ToolResult` dataclasses with auto-truncation), each `AgentLoop.run()` iteration is explicit: model response → is it a function call? → execute → append to contents → continue. This fits in ~470 lines and is trivially swappable to other languages (replace `run_linter` with ESLint, `run_tests` with Jest, etc.).

### How the reflection step works
When the LLM emits a review JSON with `confidence < 0.6`, `ReflectionLoop.build_reflection_prompt()` creates a prompt that lists the tool evidence gathered so far and explicitly asks: *"Review the evidence above and reconsider your assessment. Are there additional issues? Were any incorrectly identified?"* This is appended as a user message and the model is re-queried once.

### Graceful failure handling
Every `ToolResult` wraps errors (missing binary, timeout, non-existent file) so the LLM sees `{"success": false, "error": "..."}` rather than a crash. The agent loop continues; if output is truncated at 3000 chars, the LLM is told so. If the agent exceeds 6 iterations without producing valid JSON, the error is returned for human inspection.

## Setup

### Requirements
- **Python 3.11+**
- A **free Groq API key** from [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure
```bash
python -m pr_triage_agent init
# Edit the .env file that was created:
#   GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
#   GITHUB_TOKEN=optional_github_token
```

> **Note:** Without `GITHUB_TOKEN`, unauthenticated GitHub API calls are limited to 60/hour. Set one for development use (no special permissions needed — public repo access only).

---

## Usage

### Review a PR
```bash
python -m pr_triage_agent review https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6963
```

### Review a local branch
```bash
python -m pr_triage_agent review \
    https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6963 \
    --repo-path /path/to/repo \
    --base main \
    --head feature-branch
```

### Run evaluation against the dataset
```bash
python -m pr_triage_agent eval
python -m pr_triage_agent eval --limit 3         # first 3 PRs
python -m pr_triage_agent eval --no-skip-existing  # re-run all
```

### Demo (no API key needed)
```bash
python pr_triage_agent/assets/demo_review.py
```

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

- **Small evaluation set** — 16 PRs provides directional signal but isn't statistically significant. Growing the dataset to 100+ PRs across more languages would improve confidence.
- **Python-only tools** — Linter, tester, and SAST are all Python tools (ruff, pytest, bandit). The architecture supports swapping these, but no other languages are wired yet.
- **Free-tier constraints** — Groq's free tier allows 1,000 requests/day (30 RPM) with a 128K token context. Large diffs (>50 files) may need chunking.
- **No inline PR comments** — The agent outputs structured JSON but doesn't post comments to GitHub yet (intentional — review is human-gated).
- **Single-pass reflection** — The reflection loop runs at most once. A more sophisticated agent might do recursive search (find issue → search related code → refine).
- **No streaming** — The full agent loop runs synchronously. Could add streaming output via `rich.live` for a smoother UX.
